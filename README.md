In real-world melanoma screening, most AI models trained on 2D dermoscopic images donâ€™t generalize to 3D full-body imaging. The project aimed to boost cross-dataset generalization by unifying ISIC 2024 and iToBoS. A metadata-aware pipeline aligned key fields (e.g., body_part, age_at_baseline), standardized images, and trained a multimodal image-plus-tabular classifier with domain adaptation. The adapted ISIC+iToBoS model outperformed single-dataset baselines, reaching 62.3% accuracy, 0.414 F1, and 0.709 ROC-AUC, evidence of more clinic-ready generalization.
